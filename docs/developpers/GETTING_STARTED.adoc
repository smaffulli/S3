=================================

[.lead]
This set of documents aims at bootstrapping developpers with Zenko's Cloudserver
module, so they can then go on and contribute features.
In order to achieve this, we're going to cover a number of subjects:

- <<cloning-and-building,cloning, installing, and building your own image>>; 
- <<support-new-public-cloud, adding support to a new public cloud backend>>;
- <<telling-story-usecase, telling the community about your story or usecase>>.

== [[cloning-and-building]]
== Cloning, installing, and building your own image

To clone Zenko's Cloudserver, simply run:

 ~# git clone https://github.com/scality/S3 cloudserver
 ~# cd cloudserver

To install all dependencies (necessary to run), do:

 ~/cloudserver# npm install

TIP: Some optional dependencies may fail, resulting in you seeing `NPM WARN`
     messages; these can safely be ignored.

// Add link to user doc
To run the service locally, use:

 ~/cloudserver# npm start

TIP: Refer to the User documentation for all available options

// Add link to Docker doc
To build your own Docker image, run:

 ~/cloudserver# docker build . -t {{YOUR_DOCKERHUB_ACCOUNT}}/cloudserver:{{OPTIONAL_VERSION_TAG}}

To then push your Docker image to your own hub, run:

 ~/cloudserver# docker push {{YOUR_DOCKERHUB_ACCOUNT}}/cloudserver:{{OPTIONAL_VERSION_TAG}}

NOTE: To perform this last operation, you will need to be authenticated with
      DockerHub

IMPORTANT: Should you want to request a new backend support, please do so by$
           opening a Github issue, and filling out the "Feature Request" section
           of our template. Thanks!

We always encourage our community to offer new extensions to Zenko, and new
backend support is paramount to meeting more community needs.
If that is something you want to contribute (or just do on your own version of
the cloudserver image), go read our link:NEW_BACKEND.adoc[step-by-step guide] on
where to start to add support for a new backend.
